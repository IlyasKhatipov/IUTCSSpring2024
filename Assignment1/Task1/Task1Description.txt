A. Task 1
time limit per test2.5 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes
Given an alphabet Σ
 as input, construct the following 3 languages:

L1 = { s ∈
 Σ∗
 | each symbol in s appears even number of times };
L2 = { s ∈
 Σ∗
 | all symbols from Σ are present in s };
L3 = { s ∈
 Σ∗
 | exactly one symbol from Σ does not appear in s };
Input
The first line contains number N (1≤N≤15
) – number of symbols in the alphabet.

The second line contains N space-separated symbols (lower-case English letters and numbers 0-9).

The third line contains three numbers M, K and L (1≤M≤1000
, 1≤K≤1000
, 1≤L≤1000
) – how many strings to output for each language.

Output
Should contain three lines:

The first line of output has to contain the first M strings of language L1.
The second line of output has to contain the first K strings of language L2.
The third line of output has to contain the first L strings of language L3.

a b
6 6 6
OutputСкопировать
_ aa bb aaaa aabb abab
ab ba aab aba abb baa
a b aa bb aaa bbb
Note
String ordering: the shortest strings come first. Two strings of equal length are compared lexicographically. For example, "bb" < "aaa", "abc" < "bbc".
Use character "_" to represent the empty string.
We guarantee that each language will have at least that many strings (M for L1, K for L2 and L for L3).
