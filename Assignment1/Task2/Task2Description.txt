Given a Finitie State Automaton (FSA) and a set of strings, say which strings are accepted by the automaton.

Input
The first line contains numbers Q, S, F and N – number of states, input symbols, final states and words to check.
The second line contains Q space-separated strings, representing the set of states of the FSA.
The third line contains S space-separated symbols forming alphabet of the FSA.
The following Q • S lines contain the transition function of FSA in the form of space-separated triplets (State, Input, New State).
The next line contains the starting state.
The next line contains F space-separated accepting states of the FSA.
The final line contains N space-separated words.
Output
Should contain a single line with N letters 'A' or 'R', standing for Accept and Reject respectively.

Note
All strings consist of English letters and numbers 0-9. The only exception is string "_", representing the empty string. It may only appear among N words on the final input line.
The transition function is guaranteed to be total.
